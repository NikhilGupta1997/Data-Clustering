# Data-Mining-Algorithms

This library has support for various data clustering algorithms as well as frequent-subgraph-mining on graph datasets.

## Data Clustering
We provide support for the following algorithms on datasets ranging from 1 - 5 features dimensions.

+ K-Means
+ DBScan
+ OPTICS

## Frequent-Subgraph-Mining
We support the implementation of the gSpan algorithm on graph datasets. We provide an example on the classification of active molecules in chemical compounds w.r.t. a particular disease.   
The algorithms we discuss are:

+ FSG
+ GSpan
+ Gaston
